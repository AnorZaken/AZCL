# AZCL
Work in progress - so please come back later. :)

AZCL is a well documented ease-of-use library designed to save time by solving mostly small mundane code tasks - most of which you don't do every day, but that most programmers need every now and then.
For example: Linq and other support for multi-rank arrays, Unions/Hashing/Bit-manipulation, thin read-only wrappers for arrays, IComparer compositioning etc.

There is also some other stuff in there, such as:
- Java-style enumeration types (An enum type that guarantees valid values and allows custom methods).
- Static Meta classes for inquiring various information about generic types at runtime,
  can for example do try-conversions between int-types and/or enum-types without any try-catch nastiness!

AZCL's key-phrase is "Handy, well documented, and performant".
